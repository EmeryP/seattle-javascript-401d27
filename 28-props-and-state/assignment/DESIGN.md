![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) DESIGN - Card and Deck Basics
===================================================================

## Assignment
For this warm-up, we'll be creating a new repo where we'll be storing our design as we build it throughout the course.

During your build-outs of React components, you'll be pulling from and adding to this repo, moving things around, and generally setting up your personal design workflow.

### Requirements
Work in a fork of your "sass-design" repository in your github account
* Create a partial for both cards (`_cards.scss`) and decks (`_decks.scss`)
* For decks, create rules to style 1, 2, 3 column displays
  * Incorporate bleed, border style, background color (placemat) variables from the `_variables` partial
  * Use a mixin to calculate space
  * Use either float or grid, perhaps with a fallback
* For cards, create the following layouts:
  * Stacked: Image|Title|Copy|Links
  * Image Left
  * Image Right


### Submission Instructions
Report in canvas with a link to the PR for this branch.  You may merge it to master after your submission is turned in.
